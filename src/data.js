    info:
      "Released in 1972, the Royal Oak was the first stainless steel watch marketed as a luxury piece. It was a different era: in the early 1970s, when men still needed to wear watches to keep track of the time, they chose between stainless steel watches and dressy pieces built for black-tie soirees. The Royal Oak bridged those two worlds, creating a luxury watch out of the more durable steel. With its steel case, octagonal bezel, “tapisserie” dial and integrated bracelet, the Royal Oak overturned the prevailing codes in 1972 and took its rightful place as a true modern icon.",
